  <h1>Practice html, css</h1>
  <p>This is a test  website using the tutorial from <a href=http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/>Building Your First Webpage</a> I was refered to this webpage by the University of michigan coursera course.</p>
  <p>I have attached the css style sheet.  I am removing html's default formatting using <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">Eric Meyer's reset</a> which I have copied into my style sheet
  </br>
  Now my website looks very boring.  This tutorial also suggests <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">Normalize.css</a>  by Nocolas Gallagar.  However that requires a stronger understanding of css.  Babysteps.</p>
